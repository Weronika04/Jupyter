    "In this essay I will focus on the importance of communication in today's globalized society, which has never been greater. Quite a number of modern studies highlight that connecting individuals and modern technology, such as the internet, is actually helping to tear down geographical borders. The comming together of countries and cultures need improved communication. However, with over 7,000 languages spoken worldwide, communication in a globalized culture has become a major challenge. In the following essay I will provide several vital aspects of the role of linguistics in translation as well as some of the functions which one can use for essay analysis in Jupyter Notebook."

The grammar utilized, the meaning of the words as separate components, as well as the phrases and sentences they produce, how those phrases are placed in time and history, and so on, must all be determined.\n",
    "Although each language has its own set of linguistic functions, there are certain commonalities among them. An accurate translation must identify the similarities and differences between the two languages. Depending just on one aspect, such as grammar, will not result in an optimal translation. If the other functions aren't fully realized, it may be missing essential information."
